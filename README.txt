FOLDER CONTAINING CODES TO DO PTV

this folder containes the codes necessary to do background subtraction, particle finding, 2D particle tracking, and center to ray conversion.
Following ray generation the c++ implementation of STM matching can be ran.
Triangulated particle positions can then be read in and tracked in 3d, note this is not that computationallly expensive and the _out.h5 file from STM can be downloaded and 
tracking done locally if desired ... 

A sample script called "BTV.m" is provided. Navigate to a directory where new files can be made and stored. Adjust the file inputs and run BTV.m to get rays for triangulation.
